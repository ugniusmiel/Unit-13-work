# colour

i chose these colour scheme because of my Research i have seen a few websites use a type of blue colour and i think it works great with a website about phones and also i chose these colour because they are eye catching but not to bright. i also chose this because of colour blind people.

first colour pallet [Pallet 1](https://paletton.com/#uid=a3+4B1ksutJhCBymDvauynIzSiIku2kglOrHr1otAGfRM6at)

![Pallet 1](../../src/img/Pallet1.png)

* primary colour

    * .color-primary-0 { color: #2828A6 }	
    * .color-primary-1 { color: #6767C2 }
    * .color-primary-2 { color: #4545AE }
    * .color-primary-3 { color: #191984 }
    * .color-primary-4 { color: #0E0E68 }

* complementary colour 

    * .color-complement-0 { color: #420E6D }	
    * .color-complement-1 { color: #6A3694 }
    * .color-complement-2 { color: #551C83 }
    * .color-complement-3 { color: #310555 }
    * .color-complement-4 { color: #200238 }

i will be using primary colour 0 for the navigation bar and i will be using the primary colour 2 for the phone list drop list. i will also be using the complementary colour 0 for links i have been on before and the links i am on right now.the text will be all black.

second colour pallet [Pallet 2](https://paletton.com/#uid=a3+3l1ktBohv57yuxgPtpxMq6KpkCczknzKZsTG6A6poBJjg)

for my second pallet i will use the same as the first one but i will make the dropdown box that your on complementary colour 2 so you know where you are.

# fonts

[font 1](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Prompt?category=Serif,Sans+Serif#standard-styles) Prompt, Regular 400

font-family: 'Prompt', sans-serif;

![Font 1](../../src/img/PromptFont1.png)

i will use the first font for heading/subheadings mainly. i chose this font because is very similar to the regular one and a lot of websites use the regular font so i think it will work well with my website.



[font 2](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Pro?category=Serif,Sans+Serif)

font-family: 'Crimson Pro', serif;

![Font 2](../../src/img/PromptFont2.png)

i will use my second font as the main one for writing. the reason i used this font is because very similar to the regular but a bit more fancy so i am sure that this will work well as the main font.

have made two layouts for my website both using different colour scheme 
# layout 1

## colour

With the research i did i have chosen a colour scheme to go with the first layout i have chosen this colour scheme because i have realized that a lot of phone company's make there web pages a type of blue colour. the blue i used is an eye caching colour and its also easy on colour blind people.
