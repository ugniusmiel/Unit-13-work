The scroll bar doesn't save after clicking on a phone.
This is a bit tedious to having to scroll all the way down expecting seamless transitions to and from phone.

The Text for each phone name & price is not very well laid out.
The price tag would benefit greatly from having it more attractive on it's own like different color and a bit bigger to emphasis.

The description is missing some info like a table with it's specifications which is a must have for users who are after the specs rather than looks.

The design is really nice and thought of, the scroll bar action is a nice idea and it seems you wanted seamless transition which would of been great to see. The colours are not matching the main page (red colour) where phones are very bright to see the details. Recommend using a darker contrast with white text colours.

Overall I quite like the design, if it had more time it would of been perfected.
